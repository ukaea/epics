<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>PvaClient is a synchronous API for accessing PVData via PVAccess.
It also provides a number of convenience methods.
It allows the client to request access without checking for failure,
but throws an exception if a request fails.
A client can also check for failues and thus prevent exceptions.</p>

<p>The PvaClient API has the following features:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provides a synchronous API rather than the callback API provided by pvAccess.</li>
  <li>Makes common requests pva.</li>
  <li>Provides full access to the pvAccess API for more demanding
  applications</li>
  <li>Allows efficient client side programs.</li>
  <li>Takes care of most object resource management problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple examples of using pva:</p>
<pre>
// pvaGet
PvaClientPtr pva = PvaClient::create();
double value = pva-&gt;channel("exampleDouble")-&gt;get()-&gt;getData()-&gt;getDouble();

// pvaPut
PvaClientChannelPtr channel = pva-&gt;channel("exampleDouble");
PvaClientPutPtr put = channel-&gt;put();
PvaClientPutDataPtr putData = put-&gt;getData();
putData-&gt;putDouble(3.0); put-&gt;put();

// pvaMonitor
PvaClientMonitorPtr monitor = pva-&gt;channel("examplePowerSupply")-&gt;monitor("");
PvaClientMonitorDataPtr pvaData = monitor-&gt;getData();
while(true) {
    monitor-&gt;waitEvent();
    cout &lt;&lt; "changed\n";
    pvaData-&gt;showChanged(cout);
    cout &lt;&lt; "overrun\n";
    pvaData-&gt;showOverrun(cout);
    monitor-&gt;releaseEvent();
}

// pvaProcess
PvaClientChannelPtr channel = pva-&gt;channel("exampleDouble");
PvaClientProcessPtr process = channel-&gt;createProcess();
process-&gt;process();

</pre>
<p><b>pvClientCPP/example</b> includes a number of examples.</p>
<p>pvaClient does <b>not</b> provide support for:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>ChannelArray</dt>
     <dd>TBD</dd>
   <dt>ChannelRPC</dt>
     <dd>pvAccess itself already provides a synchronous interface.
       The examples include helloWorldRPC, which is an example of using channelRP.
     </dd>
</dl>

<h2>PvaClient</h2>
<p>An instance of PvaClient is obtained via the call:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientPtr pva = PvaClient::create();
</pre>

<p>PvaClient has methods to create instances of <b>PvaClientChannel</b>.
The client can specify the provider name or use the default provider.
The client can manage it's own channels or can let pvaClient cache channels.
An example of using the cached method is:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientChannelPtr pvaChannel = pva-&gt;channel("exampleDouble");
</pre>
<p>This will attempt to connect to channel exampleDouble.
Since the client did not specify a timeout an exception wll be thrown if
the connection request fails.
The client will block until the connection is made or an exception is thrown.
If the request succeeds, pva caches the pvaChannel so that if the
client makes another request for the same channel the cached object is
returned to the client.
</p>
<p>An example of using a non cached method is:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientChannelPtr pvaChannel = pva-&gt;createChannel("exampleDouble");
</pre>
<p>This will create an PvaClientChannel and return it to the client.
The client must itself connect.
This is useful if the client wants to connect to multiple channels in parallel.
</p>

<h2>PvaClientChannel - Wrapper For Single Channel</h2>
<h3>PvaClientChannel</h3>
<p>This provides methods for connecting to a channel and for creating instances of
PvaClientField, PvaClientProcess, ..., PvaClientPutGet.</p>
<p>Connection must be made before any create  method is called or
an exception is raised.
The following is a synchronous connection request:</p>
<pre>
pvaChannel-&gt;connect(5.0); // BLOCKS AND THROWS IF NO CONNECT
</pre>
<p>This blocks until then connection is made or until timout occurs.
An exception is raised if the connection request fails.
</p>
<p>The same request can be made without blocking and without exceptions.</p>
<pre>
pvaChannel-&gt;issueConnect(); // DOES NOT BLOCK
.....
Status status =pvaChannel-&gt;waitConnect(5.0);  // BLOCKS DOES NOT THROW
if(!status.isOK()) {
   // failure do something
}
</pre>
<p>Once the channel is connected other PvaClient objects can be created.
For example:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientGetPtr pvaGet = pvaChannel-&gt;get(); // DOES BLOCK
</pre>
<p>This is a caching request.
If the client already has made an identical request the client will receive the
cached object.
If a new pvaGet is created than it is connected before it is returned to the client.
</p>
<p>The client can also managed it's own objects:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientGetPtr pvaGet = pvaChannel-&gt;createGet(); // DOES NOT BLOCK
</pre>
<p>The client must connect the pvaGet.</p>

<h3>PvaClientGetData</h3>
<p>This provides the data returned by pvaGet and pvaPutGet.
It is obtained via:</p>
<pre>
PvaClientGetDataPtr pvaData = pvaGet-&gt;getData();
</pre>
<p>It provides methods to get everything returned by channelGet.
In addition there are methods that make it easier to handle a value
field that is a scalar or a scalarArray.
Also for a scalar that is a double or a scalarArray with element type double.
</p>
<p>An example is:</p>
<pre>
double value = pvaData-&gt;getDouble();
</pre>
<p>It also keeps a bitSet showing which fields have changed since the last channelGet or channelPutGet.</p>

<h3>PvaClientMonitorData</h3>
<p>To the client this looks identical to PvaClientGetData except that
it provides two BitSets: changedBitSet and overrrunBitSet.
It is used by pvaMonitor.
</p>
<h3>PvaClientPutData</h3>
<p>This is used to provided data for pvaPut and pvaPutGet.
It has many of the same methods as pvaGetData.
It does not have a bitSet.
It also has put methods like:</p>
<pre>
void pvaData-&gt;putDouble(5.0);
</pre>
<h3>PvaClientGet</h3>
<p>This provides methods to connect to channelGet and to issue get request.
To connect via a single synchronous call:</p>
<pre>
eastGet-&gt;connect();  // BLOCKS AND CAN THROW
</pre>
<p>This can also be done in two steps:</p>
<pre>
pvaGet-&gt;issueConnect(); // DOES NOT BLOCK
...
Status status = pvaGet-&gt;waitConnect(); // BLOCKS AND DOES NOT HROW
</pre>
<p>Once connected gets are issued via either:</p>
<pre>
void pvaGet-&gt;get(); // BLOCKS AND CAN THROW
</pre>
or
<pre>
pvaGet-&gt;issueGet(); // DOES NOT BLOCK
...
Status status = pvaGet-&gt;waitGet(); // BLOCKS AND DOES NOT THROW
</pre>
<h3>PvaClientPut</h3>
<p>This is similar to pvaGet except that it wraps channelPut instead of channelGet.
</p>
<p>Once connected puts are issued via either:</p>
<pre>
void pvaPut-&gt;put(); // BLOCKS AND CAN THROW
</pre>
or
<pre>
pvaPut-&gt;issuePut(); // DOES NOT BLOCK
...
Status status = pvaPut-&gt;waitPut(); // BLOCKS AND DOES NOT THROW
</pre>
<h3>PvaClientMonitor</h3>
<p>Connecting is similar to pvaGet and pvaPut.
The other methods are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>start</dt>
     <dd>Starts monitoring</dd>
   <dt>stop</dt>
     <dd>Stops monitoring</dd>
   <dt>poll</dt>
     <dd>polls for a monitorEvent.
      The data is avalable via pvaMonitorData.
     </dd>
   <dt>releaseEvent</dt>
      <dd>Release the data from the last poll.
       Note that this must be called before another poll is requested.
       </dd>
   <dt>waitEvent</dt>
      <dd>Block until a monitorEvent is available.
      If true is returned a poll has already been issued.
      </dd>
   <dt>setRequester</dt>
      <dd>A client callback is registered to receive notice of monitorEvents.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>PvaClientProcess</h3>
<p>Connecting is similar to pvaGet.
It has methods:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>process</dt>
     <dd>call issueProcess and waitProcess.</dd>
   <dt>issueProcess</dt>
      <dd>call channelProcess-&gt;process() and return immediately.
      </dd>
   <dt>waitProcess</dt>
      <dd>Wait for process to complete.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>PvaClientPutGet</h3>
<p>Connecting is similar to pvaGet.
It has methods:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>putGet</dt>
       <dd>calls issuePutGet and waitPutGet.
        throws an exception if not successfull.
       </dd>
    <dt>issuePutGet</dt>
        <dd>
         Calls channel-&gt;putGet() and returns.
        </dd>
    <dt>waitPutGet</dt>
        <dd>
          Waits until putGet completes and returns status.
        </dd>
    <dt>getGet,issueGetGet, and waitGetGet</dt>
        <dd>Gets the data for the get part of channelPutGet.</dd>
    <dt>getPut,issueGetPut,and waitGetPut</dt>
        <dd>Gets the data for the put part of channelPutGet.</dd>
    <dt>getPutData</dt>
        <dd>
         Returns the PvaClientData for the put part of channelPutGet.
        </dd>
    <dt>getGetData</dt>
        <dd>
         Returns the PvaClientData for the get part of channelPutGet.
        </dd>
</dl>
