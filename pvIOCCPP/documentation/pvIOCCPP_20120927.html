<h2 class="nocount">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This is the 27-Sep-2012 version of the C++ implementation of pvIOC. This
release implements only the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>v3Channel</dt>
    <dd>This provides pvAccess for V3 records.</dd>
  <dt>channelProviderLocal</dt>
    <dd>Provides a context for a pvAccess channelProvider named local.</dd>
  <dt>multiValue</dt>
    <dd>Support that creates channels for channelProviderLocal.
     Each channel has a top level Structure that has an alarm and a timeStamp field.
     If addition the top level structure has a a set of fields where each field is the
     value field of a channel provided by another provider.</dd>
  <dt>service</dt>
    <dd>Support for implementing services.</dd>
  <dt>ezchannelRPC</dt>
    <dd>Client code that issues a channelRPC request</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following is a list of unresolved issues for pvIOCCPP:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>LOTS AND LOTS</dt>
    <dd>Almost none of the desired features for a pvIOC are implemented.
      See the next section for some details.
    </dd>
  <dt>ezchannelRPC</dt>
     <dd>This is now implemented in pvAccess. Remove it from pvIOCCPP.</dd>
  <dt>service</dt>
     <dd>Remove everything except channelBase* and then rename directory to
       channelBase. In fact move channelBase to pvAccess.</dd>
  <dt>v3Array</dt>
     <dd>The current application does not implement shareData.
     The key is to implement a special C++ Allocator.
     This is important for beam line image applications.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 class="nocount">Future Plans For pvIOCCPP</h2>

<p>What is currently implemented by pvIOCCPP has almost non of the features
that a pvIOC is expected to provide.
Read the documentation for pvIOCJava to see what a full implementation
should provide.</p>
<p>Other then service and ezchannelRPC, which should be moved to pvAccessCPP,
the only things currently provided are v3Channel, channelProviderLocal, and multiChannel.</p>
<p>v3Channel, which is a channelProvider for V3 records, is quite usedful and should remain
a feature.</p>
<p>channelProviderLocal provides a framework for a channelProvider with the name local.
It is a very weak version of pvIOCJava implements.
It provides a pvAccess context and allows code to register channelProvider instances.
BUT each instance must itself implement ChannelProvider and Channel.
To fully implement Channel is a major task as will be seen when we next discuss multiChannel.</p>
<p>multiChannel implements ChannelProvider, Channel, and ChannelGet.
Each instance provides a channel that holds data from a set of channels obtained
from another channelProvider. The most useful is the v3Channel provider. It then
provides data from a set of V3 records.
But multiChannel is very limited.
It currently only implements channelGet, only returns the complete set of data
that the instance is configured to collect, and
acts like every data value changed on every get request.
What is required is a much more.</p>
<p>The minimum features provided by pvIOCJava that should be implemented by pvIOCCPP are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>database</dt>
     <dd>This is a databbase of PVRecords. Each record has a name, which is the
    channelName, and holds a top level PVStructure.</dd>
   <dt>install</dt>
     <dd>This is a facility to dynamically add and delete PVRecords.</dd>
   <dt>pvCopy</dt>
      <dd>Creates a PVStructure that contains a copy of an arbitary
          subset of the fields of another top level PVStructure.
        It can copy data between the two and maintains a bitSet that show which fields
       are changed.<dd>
   <dt>monitor</dt>
      <dd>This provides the ability to monitor changes in the fields of a record.</dd>
   <dt>support</dt>
     <dd>Support makes the database <b>smart</b> because it attaches code to records.<br />
        This provides two features:
        <dl>
           <dt>recordSupport</dt>
             <dd>This is support that is responsible for <b>processing</b> a PVRecord,
             which means calling support attached to the record.</dd>
           <dt>support</dt>
             <dd>Each field of a PVRecord can optionally have code attached to it.
              The code is called when a record is processed.
             Some generic support code is provided but additional code can be provided.</dd>
        </dl>
     </dd>
   <dt>localChannelProvider</dt>
     <dd>localChannelProvider will access data from records using the features above.
     It will implement all channel methods except channelRPC.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After the minimum featues the following should be implemented:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>portDriver<dt>
     <dd>This is meant as the successor to the asynManager component of the
     asyn driver for epics V3.</dd>
   <dt>xml</dt>
     <dd>This is used to define PVRecords via files with xml syntax.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>pvIOCCPP is one of a set of related projects. This project uses projects
pvDataCPP and pvAccessCPP. It is assumed that the reader is familar with these
projects.</p>

<p>At the present time the only parts of pvIOCCP that are implemented are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>v3Channel</dt>
    <dd>This provides pvAccess for V3 records.</dd>
  <dt>channelProviderLocal</dt>
    <dd>This implements a channel provider named "local".
     It interfaces with pvAccess and allows code that implements channel
     instances to register channel instances with it.</dd>
   <dt>multiValue</dt>
      <dd>This allows the creation of channels that hold data from a
      set of V3 records. For now only channelGet is supported.</dd>
  <dt>service</dt>
    <dd>Support for implementing services.
     <b>This is going to go away.</b></dd>
  <dt>ezchannelRPC</dt>
    <dd>Client code that issues a channelRPC request.
     <b>This is being moved to pvAccess.</b></dd>
</dl>

<p>These are described in this document. Everything else that appears in this
project is work in progress.</p>

<p>A complete Java implementation of pvIOC (pvIOCJava) is available but it can
not be used inside a V3 IOC.</p>

<p>Doxygen documentation is available at <a
href="./html/index.html">doxygenDoc</a></p>


<h2>V3Channel</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>V3Channel provides access to V3 records.
It can be used by other code in the same IOC
or by pvAccess network clients via remote pvAccess.
It implements channelProcess, channelGet, channelPut, channelArray,
and Monitor. It does not implement channelPutGet or channelRPC since, at least
for now, these do not apply to V3 records.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to map what V3 records provide into a PVStruructure that
has the same information. For example if a client makes the following request:</p>
<pre>
pvget -r "field()" quadruple:BField
</pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre>
scalar_t 
    double value 0
    alarm_t alarm
        int severity 3
        int status 0
        string message UDF
    timeStamp_t timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 631152000
        int nanoSeconds 0
        int userTag 0
    display_t display
        double limitLow 0
        double limitHigh 10
        string description 
        string format %f
        string units tesla
    control_t control
        double limitLow 0
        double limitHigh 10
        double minStep 0
    valueAlarm_t valueAlarm
        boolean active false
        double lowAlarmLimit 2
        double lowWarningLimit 4
        double highWarningLimit 6
        double highAlarmLimit 8
        int lowAlarmSeverity 0
        int lowWarningSeverity 0
        int highWarningSeverity 0
        int highAlarmSeverity 0
        double hystersis 0
</pre>

<p>The channelName can be either just a record name or a "recordName.XXX" where
XXX is the V3 field name, e. g. "SCAN".</p>


<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p><b>NOTE: </b>pvIOCCP has a iocBoot directory structure like any V3
application.
To see an example do the following:</p>
<p>In one window:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/mrk/hg/pvIOCCPP/iocBoot/simpleV3Channel
mrk&gt;../../bin/linux-x86_64/simpleV3Channel st.cmd
</pre>
<p>In another window:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pvget -r "field()" TESTDOUBLE
</pre>

<p>pvIOCCPP runs in a regular V3 IOC as defined by EPICS base. It uses the base
build system and is built as an EPICS application. To use V3Channel do the
following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Create an epics application</dt>
<dd>Look at the example (pvIOCCPP/exampleApp/simpleV3Channel) to see how create an application
or use the MakeBaseApp that comes with EPICS base.</dd>
<dt>configure/RELEASE</dt>
<dd>Add the location of pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP, and PVIOCCP. For example: 
<pre>PVBASE=/home/mrk/hg
PVDATA=${PVBASE}/pvDataCPP
PVACCESS=${PVBASE}/pvAccessCPP
PVIOC=${PVBASE}/pvIOCCPP</pre>
</dd>
<dt>v3Channel.dbd</dt>
<dd>In the src directory where your application is being built add an
include statement for v3Channel.dbd. For example: 
<pre>include "base.dbd"
include "v3Channel.dbd"</pre>
</dd>
<dt>st.cmd</dt>
<dd>After the iocInit command in the st.cmd file add: 
<pre>startV3Channel</pre>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>
Most readers can skip this section.</p>
<p>This section is only of interest to someone who wants to understand
the internals of v3Channel.
Because v3Channel transfers data between pvData and V3 records it is complex.
To understand it requires a knowledge of the internals of the V3 database and of
pvData.</p>

<h4>Introduction to Implementation</h4>
<p>The implementation consists of the following header files:</p>
<dl>
<dt>v3Channel.h</dt>
<dd>The V3Channel interface. It defines extensions for both ChannelProvider
and Channel.</dd>
<dt>v3Util.h</dt>
<dd>The interace for transfering data between V3 records and pvData, i. e.
the code that converts between the V3 data and pvData.</dd>
<dt>v3Array.h</dt>
<dd>Because arrays are more complex than scalar data they are handled by a
separate interface instead of by v3Util itself.</dd>
<dt>v3CAMonitor.h</dt>
<dd>db_post_event is implement in code (dbEvent) that passes events
directly to CAV3. Thus the only way V3Channel can trap monitors is via
CAV3. V3Channel only uses CAV3 for scalar numeric data, timeStamp, and
alarms. All other monitored data is obtained from the V3 record
itself.</dd>
<dt>CAV3Context.h</dt>
<dd>This is code that interfaces between pvAccess threads and CAV3
context.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Associated with each header file is a corresponding implementation file
which has the same file name as the header but with an extension of ".cpp". The
remainder of this section gives a brief description of each of these software
components with an emphasis on how data is converted between pvData and data in
V3 records.</p>

<h4>Remaining tasks</h4>
The main remaining tasks are: 
<dl>
<dt>Access Security</dt>
<dd>Since V3Channnel is not using any of the remote part of V3CA, it
"sidesteps" access security. The V3 access security system is independent
of CAV3 so V3Channel will be able to implement access security without
going through V3CA but this has not been done.</dd>
<dt>Monitor Algorithm</dt>
<dd>pvIOCJava supports an extensible set of monitor algorithms. It provides
support for onChange and onPercentChange but allows additional
algorithms. This same support will be implemented by pvIOCCP.</dd>
<dt>V3Channel::init</dt>
<dd>This creates the introspection interface that is returned by getField.
Currently it always has property fields alarm, timeStamp, and display. If
the field is not an array it also has a property field control. It might
be better to look at the record support entry table to see if display and
control should be included.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Main Concepts</h4>

<p>In epics V3 there are two interfaces for accessing data:</p>
<dl>
<dt>db_access</dt>
<dd>This defines all the DBR_XXX types and associated C structures as seen
by CAV3 clients. V3Channel, with the exception of V3CAMonitor does not
use this. Even for monitors only a few of the DBR_XXX types are used.</dd>
<dt>dbAccess</dt>
<dd>This and some additional interfaces like the RSET (record support entry
table) and the DBADDR are what V3Channel uses to get/put data from the V3
records. Wherever possible data is accessed via the DBADDR and RSET.
pvAccess method pvPutField is used to put data to fields that have "side
effects". For example writing to the SCAN field has side effects.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>v3Channel.h</h4>

<p>This defines two interfaces:</p>
<dl>
<dt>V3ChannelProvider</dt>
<dd>The implementation of ChannelProvider.</dd>
<dt>V3Channel</dt>
<dd>The implementation of Channel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>V3ChannelProvider is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3ChannelProvider :
public epics::pvAccess::ChannelBaseProvider
{
public:
POINTER_DEFINITIONS(V3ChannelProvider);
V3ChannelProvider();
virtual ~V3ChannelProvider();
virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelFind::shared_pointer channelFind(
epics::pvData::String const &amp;channelName,
epics::pvAccess::ChannelFindRequester::shared_pointer const &amp; channelFindRequester);
virtual epics::pvAccess::Channel::shared_pointer createChannel(
epics::pvData::String const &amp;channelName,
epics::pvAccess::ChannelRequester::shared_pointer  const &amp;channelRequester,
short priority,
epics::pvData::String const &amp;address);
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>getChannelProvider</dt>
<dd>This returns the single instance od the V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
<dt>getProviderName</dt>
<dd>This returns "v3Channel"</dd>
<dt>channelFind</dt>
<dd>Calls dbNameToAddr to see if the requested channelName is in the V3
database. If calls channelFindRequester-&gt;channelFindResult to report
the result. It always returns null.</dd>
<dt>createChannel</dt>
<dd>Calls dbNameToAddr to see if the requested channelName is in the V3
database. If not it calls
channelRequester-&gt;channelCreated(notFoundStatus,0) and returns null.
If it is in the V3 database it creates a new V3Channel, calls init, calls
channelRequester-&gt;channelCreated(Status::Ok,v3Channel) and returns the
newly created V3Channel.</dd>
</dl>

<p>V3Channel is defined as:</p>
<pre>class V3Channel :
public virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelBase
{
public:
POINTER_DEFINITIONS(V3Channel);
V3Channel(
epics::pvAccess::ChannelBaseProvider::shared_pointer const &amp; channelProvider,
epics::pvAccess::ChannelRequester::shared_pointer const &amp; requester,
epics::pvData::String const &amp; name,
std::auto_ptr&lt;DbAddr&gt; addr
);
virtual ~V3Channel();
void init();
virtual void getField(
epics::pvAccess::GetFieldRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;requester,
epics::pvData::String const &amp;subField);
virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelProcess::shared_pointer createChannelProcess(
epics::pvAccess::ChannelProcessRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;channelProcessRequester,
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp;pvRequest);
virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelGet::shared_pointer createChannelGet(
epics::pvAccess::ChannelGetRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;channelGetRequester,
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp;pvRequest);
virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelPut::shared_pointer createChannelPut(
epics::pvAccess::ChannelPutRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;channelPutRequester,
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp;pvRequest);
virtual epics::pvData::Monitor::shared_pointer createMonitor(
epics::pvData::MonitorRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;monitorRequester,
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp;pvRequest);
virtual epics::pvAccess::ChannelArray::shared_pointer createChannelArray(
epics::pvAccess::ChannelArrayRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;channelArrayRequester,
epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp;pvRequest);
virtual void printInfo();
virtual void printInfo(epics::pvData::StringBuilder out);
private:
std::auto_ptr&lt;DbAddr&gt; dbAddr;
epics::pvData::FieldConstPtr recordField;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>V3Channel</dt>
<dd>This is the constructor called by V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
<dt>init</dt>
<dd>This is called by V3ChannelProvider after it has created the V3Channel.
It's primary function is to create a FieldConstPtr that provides the
introspection interface for the field being accessed. This is what is
returned by getField. It is always a structure with a value field that
has a type determined by the V3 field being accessed. It always has
property fields value, timeStamp, alarm, and display. In addition if the
value field is not an array a control property field. <b>NOTE: </b>It might be
better to look at the record support entry table to determine what
property fields to include.</dd>
<dt>destroy</dt>
<dd>This is called by whoever accesses the V3Channel. For example remote
PVAccess calls this when the client disconnects from the channel.</dd>
<dt>getRequesterName</dt>
<dd>Get the requester that created the V3Channel.</dd>
<dt>message</dt>
<dd>This is a method that can be called by any code associated with the
V3Channel. It just passes the message to the requester.</dd>
<dt>getProvider</dt>
<dd>This returns the provider which is V3ChannelProvider.</dd>
<dt>getRemoteAddress</dt>
<dd>This returns String("local").</dd>
<dt>getConnectionStatus</dt>
<dd>This returns Channel::CONNECTED;</dd>
<dt>getChannelRequester</dt>
<dd>This gets the requester that asked to create the channel.</dd>
<dt>isConnected</dt>
<dd>Always returns true.</dd>
<dt>getField</dt>
<dd>This returns the introspection interface created by init.</dd>
<dt>getAccessRights</dt>
<dd>This is currently throws an exception. As stated in the TODO list this
should interact with the V3 access security system.</dd>
<dt>createChannelProcess</dt>
<dd>This creates a V3ChannelProcess and then call V3ChannelProcess::init.
Process is implemented via a V3 dbPutNotify to the .PROC field of the
record.</dd>
<dt>createChannelGet</dt>
<dd>This creates a V3ChannelGet and then calls V3ChannelGet::init. The
implementation uses V3Util to do most of the work. See V3Util below for
details. If an option to process is given then the record is processed
via a dbPutNotify to the PROC field before data is fetched. Note that
display and control data is only returned for the first get, i.e. display
and control data do not change.</dd>
<dt>createChannelPut</dt>
<dd>This creates a V3ChannelPut and then calls V3ChannelPut::init. The
implementation uses V3Util to do most of the work. See V3Util below for
details. It is responsible for creating the PVStructure that holds the
data and for getting/putting data between the V3 record and the
PVStructure. Although properties alarm, timeStamp, control, and display
can be requested they can not be modified because V3 does not allow them
to be changed by a client. If a V3 dbPut to a field has side effects than
a put results in a call to the V3 dbPut. Examples are a put to the SCAN
field. It actually changes the scanning mechanism for the record. If a V3
dbPut does not have side effects other than causing a record to process a
put does NOT result in a call to the V3 dbPut. Instead processing is
determined by the pvAccess client. If the client requests processing the
normal pvAccess semantics are used, i. e. the record is processed via a
dbPutNotify to the PROC field after the data is written into the V3
record.</dd>
<dt>createChannelPutGet</dt>
<dd>This is not implemented since it does not make sense for V3 records.
</dd>
<dt>createChannelRPC</dt>
<dd>This is not implemented since it does not make sense for V3
records.</dd>
<dt>createMonitor</dt>
<dd>This is implemented via a monitior request call to CAV3. See
V3CaMonitor below for details.</dd>
<dt>createChannelArray</dt>
<dd>This creates a V3ChannelArray that implements the normal ChannelArray
semantics. It uses DBADDR and the RSET to direcly access the array in the
V3 record.</dd>
<dt>printInfo</dt>
<dd>This just prints a short message.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>v3Util.h</h4>

<p>This does most of the work related to transfering data between a PVStructure
and a V3 record. All methods are static and are called by V3ChannelGet,
V3ChannelPut, etc. Each first calls getProperty which returns a mask that is
passed to the other methods. The mask bits show a combination of what the
requester requested and characteristics of the V3 field being accessed. The
mask has the following bits:</p>
<dl>
<dt>processBit</dt>
<dd>The client has requested that the record be processed as part of a
ChannelGet::get or a ChannelPut::put.</dd>
<dt>shareArrayBit</dt>
<dd>The client has specified that array data be shared, e. g. has set
record[shareData=true], In this case no copy of the array data is
created. Instead data is transfered directly between network buffers and
the data array in the V3 record. If this is specified the client must
understand that if an array is split between network buffers the array
may change between buffers.</dd>

<h4>v3CAMonitor.h</h4>

<p>In V3 dbEvent is what implements db_post_event, which is what is called when
a field value changes in a V3 record. But dbEvent just passes this to V3CA.
Thus the only way to trap V3 monitors is via a call to ca_create_subscription.
The implementation takes only the following from the CAV3 event callback:
scalar value, alarm status and sererity, and the timeStamp. All other data,
e.g. array values, are taken from the record as a result of the CAV3 event
callback. </p>

<p>V3CAMonitor provides an enum that describes the data type of a V3 field as
seen by pvData.</p>
<pre>enum V3Type {
v3Enum,
v3Byte,
v3UByte,
v3Short,
v3UShort,
v3Int,
v3UInt,
v3Float,
v3Double,
v3String
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>v3Enum</dt>
<dd>A pvData enumerated structure is created for this. The monitor request
will be a DBR_TIME_ENUM. For an enum a DBF_ENUM is an index. For pvData
it is the index field on an enumerated structure.</dd>
<dt>v3Byte</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_CHAR.</dd>
<dt>v3Short</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_SHORT.</dd>
<dt>v3Int</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_LONG.</dd>
<dt>v3Float</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_FLOAT.</dd>
<dt>v3Double</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_DOUBLE.</dd>
<dt>v3String</dt>
<dd>The monitor request will be a DBR_TIME_STRING. Note that for strings
data is taken from the record not from CAV3.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Next a C structure is defined in which data from CAV3 is put. Each time CAV3
calls the event callback the CAV3 data is copied to this structure.</p>
<pre>struct CAV3Data {
CAV3Data();
~CAV3Data();
/* The following have new values after each data event*/
union { //only used for scalar values
epics::pvData::int8   byteValue;
epics::pvData::uint8  ubyteValue;
epics::pvData::uint16 ushortValue;
epics::pvData::int16  shortValue;
epics::pvData::int32  intValue;
epics::pvData::uint32 uintValue;
float                 floatValue;
double                doubleValue;
};
epicsTimeStamp  timeStamp;
int             sevr;
int             stat;
const char *    status;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>union</dt>
<dd>This holds a scalar numeric value obtained from CAV3. If the field is
an array or a DBF_STRING then the actual data is taken from the record
via the DBADDR and RSET.</dd>
<dt>timeStamp</dt>
<dd>The epics timestamp obtained from CAV3.</dd>
<dt>sevr</dt>
<dd>The severity obtained from CAV3.</dd>
<dt>stat</dt>
<dd>The status obtained from CAV3.</dd>
<dt>status</dt>
<dd>The string value associated with stat. It is taken from
epicsAlarmConditionStrings, which is an extrernal that is part of
dbAccess.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Next is an interface that provides c++ callbacks that can be called by the C
callbacks that CAV3 calls:</p>
<pre>class CAV3MonitorRequester : public virtual epics::pvData::Requester {
public:
POINTER_DEFINITIONS(CAV3MonitorRequester);
virtual ~CAV3MonitorRequester(){}
virtual void exceptionCallback(long status,long op) = 0;
virtual void connectionCallback() = 0;
virtual void accessRightsCallback() = 0;
virtual void eventCallback(const char *status) = 0;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>exceptionCallback</dt>
<dd>Called when CAV3 calls the exception callback.</dd>
<dt>connectionCallback</dt>
<dd>Called when CAV3 calls the connection callback.</dd>
<dt>accessRightsCallback</dt>
<dd>Called when CAV3 calls the access rights callback,</dd>
<dt>eventCallback</dt>
<dd>Called when CAV3 calls the event callback. The data in CAV3Data is
updated before this is called,</dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally the interface for CAV3Monitor:</p>
<pre>class CAV3Monitor : private epics::pvData::NoDefaultMethods {
public:
CAV3Monitor(
CAV3MonitorRequesterPtr const &amp;requester,
epics::pvData::String const &amp;pvName,
V3Type v3Type);
~CAV3Monitor();
CAV3Data &amp; getData();
void connect();
void start();
void stop();
const char * getStatusString(long status);
bool hasReadAccess();
bool hasWriteAccess();
bool isConnected();
private:
class CAV3MonitorPvt *pImpl;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>connect</dt>
<dd>Ask to connect. This calls ca_create_channel and
ca_replace_access_rights_event.</dd>
<dt>start</dt>
<dd>This calls ca_create_subscription.</dd>
<dt>stop</dt>
<dd>This calls ca_clear_subscription.</dd>
<dt>getStatusString</dt>
<dd>This returns ca_message(status),</dd>
<dt>hasReadAccess</dt>
<dd>This calls ca_read_access. This will always be true because CAV3 treats
this a local rather than remote client.</dd>
<dt>hasWriteAccess</dt>
<dd>This calls ca_write_access. This will always be true because CAV3
treats this a local rather than remote client.</dd>
<dt>isConnected</dt>
<dd>This calls ca_state to determine connection state. If connected this
should always return true.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>CAV3Context.h</h4>

<p>CAV3Monitor calls CAV3 in order to monitor changes to the V3 records. In
order to do this it must call ca_context_create(ca_enable_preemptive_callback).
It must call this from the thread that wil make calls to CAV3. But it must also
call ca_attach_context from any other threads associated with the thread that
calls ca_context_create. The putpose of V3CAContext is to manage this
interaction with CAV3.</p>

<p>For each thread that V3Channel uses and that makes a CreateMonitor
V3CAContext keeps a reference count. This is decremented when
CAV3Contect::release is called, which is done when a V3CAMonitor is deleted.
Only when the thread that originally resulted in a V3CAContext exits is the
V3CAContext deleted. Thus if a single client connects to several V3 records
each instance of V3Channel and all ChannelGets, etc. for that channel share the
same context.:q</p>

<p></p>

<p>V4CAContext is defined as:</p>
<pre>class CAV3Context {
public:
POINTER_DEFINITIONS(CAV3Context);
~CAV3Context();
void release();
void stop();
void exception(epics::pvData::String const &amp;message);
void checkContext();
private:
std::list&lt;epicsThreadId&gt; auxThreadList ;
epics::pvData::Mutex mutex;
CAV3Context(
epics::pvData::RequesterPtr const &amp; requester);
epics::pvData::RequesterPtr requester;
epicsThreadId threadId;
struct ca_client_context *context;
int referenceCount;
friend class CAV3ContextCreate;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>~CAV3Context</dt>
<dd>This does nothing.</dd>
<dt>release</dt>
<dd>This is called by CAV3Monitor when a monitor is being destroyed.</dd>
<dt>stop</dt>
<dd>This is called when the thread that created the CAV3Context exits. That
is when ca_context_destroy is called.</dd>
<dt>exception</dt>
<dd>This is called when CAV3 calls the exception callback that V3CAContext
registers.</dd>
<dt>checkContext</dt>
<dd>This is called before any call to CAV3. It checks to see if the calling
thread is aleady known to CAV3. If not ca_attach_contex is called.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There is a separate class for creating a context:</p>
<pre>class CAV3ContextCreate {
public:
static CAV3ContextPtr get(epics::pvData::RequesterPtr const &amp; requester);
private:
static void erase(epicsThreadId id);
static std::map&lt;epicsThreadId,CAV3ContextPtr&gt; contextMap;
static epics::pvData::Mutex mutex;
friend class CAV3Context;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
<dt>get</dt>
<dd>This checks to see if the thread has already known to CAV3, i. e. if a
CAV3Context altready exists for the calling thread. If so it is returned.
If not a new CAV3Context is created and returned.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>channelProviderLocal</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This implements a channelProvider named "local" intended for use by code that
wants to make data available to pvAccess clients.
It has the following features:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>iocsh command</dt>
      <dd>It provides a V3 ioc shell command that starts
         a single instance of channelProvider local.</dd>
   <dt>registerProvider</dt>
      <dd>It provides a method registerProvider which is called by the code
         that makes data available to pvAccess clients.
         This code DOES not have to do anything except implement the channelFind
         and channelCreate methods of ChannelBaseProvider.
         It does not need to create a context and/or register itself with pvAccess.</dd>
    <dt>pvAccess context</dt>
       <dd>The pvAccess remote server requires that each provider provide a context,
       which means a thread. channelProviderLocal provides a common context for
      every provider that calls registerProvider.</dd>
</dt>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To start localChannel provider the XXXInclude.dbd file used to build the application must
include the following:</p>
<pre>
include "channelProviderLocal.dbd"
</pre>
<p>The st.cmd file that starts the IOC must have the statement:</p>
<pre>
startChannelProviderLocal
</pre>
<p>Code that provides data via a top level PVStructure has code like:</p>
<pre>
    ChannelAccess::shared_pointer channelAccess = getChannelAccess();
    ChannelProvider::shared_pointer channelProvider = channelAccess-&gt;getProvider("local");
    ChannelProviderLocalPtr channelProviderLocal =
         static_pointer_cast&lt;ChannelProviderLocal&gt;(channelProvider);
    channelProviderLocal-&gt;registerProvider(channelName,provider);
</pre>

<h3>channelProviderLocal.h</h3>
<p>The only method of interest to code that provides data via a top level PVStructure is:</p>
<pre>
    ChannelProviderLocalPtr channelProviderLocal =
         static_pointer_cast&lt;ChannelProviderLocal&gt;(channelProvider);
    channelProviderLocal-&gt;registerProvider(channelName,provider);
</pre>

<h2>multiValue</h2>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>To see an example of multiChannel start the following IOC:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/mrk/hg/pvIOCCPP/iocBoot/testMultiValue
mrk&gt; ../../bin/linux-x86_64/testMultiValue st.cmd
</pre>
<p>A dbl command shows the following V3 records are present:</p>
<pre>
epics&gt; dbl
quadruple:BField
quadruple:Current
quadruple:POLYNOMIAL
</pre>
<p>Then in another window:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/mrk/hg/pvIOCCPP/iocBoot/testMultiValue
mrk&gt; source clientTest 
</pre>
<p>The file clientTest contains:</p>
<pre>
pvput quadruple:BField 1
pvput quadruple:Current 5
pvput quadruple:POLYNOMIAL 1,2,3,4,5
pvget quadruple
</pre>
<p>You should see:</p>
<pre>

    double[] conversionPolynomial [1,2,3,4,5]
</pre>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>MultiValue provides support for creating pvAccess channels that are made available via
channelProviderLocal. Each channel holds data from the value fields of a set of channels provided
by another channel provider. A primary use is the collect data from a set of V3 records in the
same IOC.</p>
<p>Each channel has a top level structure that has an alarm and timeStamp field.
In addition there is a field for each value field obtained from the other channel provider.</p>
<p>iocBoot/testMultiValue provides an example of how multiChannel is used.</p>
<p>The V3 database that is loaded is:</p>
<pre>
record(waveform, "quadruple:POLYNOMIAL")
{...}
record(ai, "quadruple:Current")
{...}
record(ai, "quadruple:BField")
{...}
</pre>
<p>The st.cmd file ends with:</p>
<pre>
createMultiValueChannel quadrupole.txt
</pre>
<p>The field quadrupole.txt contains:</p>
<pre>
channelValueProvider v3Channel
channelName quadrupole
channelValue
    bfield quadrupole:BField
    current quadrupole:Current
    conversionPolynomial quadrupole:POLYNOMIAL
</pre>
<p>This says to create a pvAccess channel with channelName quadrupole.
The channel provider for the data fields is v3Channel, i.e. the provider that accesses
V3 records.</p>
<p>The command:</p>
<pre>
pvget -r "field()" quadrupole
</pre>
<p> will return the following structure:</p>
<pre>
structure 
    alarm_t alarm
        int severity 3
        int status 0
        string message UDF
    timeStamp_t timeStamp
        long secondsPastEpoch 1348772838
        int nanoSeconds 832012665
        int userTag 0
    double bfield 1
    double current 5
    double[] conversionPolynomial [1,2,3,4,5]
</pre>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Look at pvIOCCPP/testApp/testMultiValue for an example of how to create
an application that uses the multiChannel support.
Look at pvIOCCPP/iocBoot/testMultiValue for an example of how to create a multiChannel
instance. The st.cmd file ends with:
</pre>
createMultiValue quadruple.txt
</pre>
<p>This creates a multiChannel channel defined by file quadruple.txt which contains:</p>
<pre>
channelValueProvider v3Channel
channelName quadruple
channelValue
    bfield quadruple:BField
    current quadruple:Current
    conversionPolynomial quadruple:POLYNOMIAL
</pre>

<h3>createMultiValueChannel</h3>
<p>Files createMultiValue.dbd and createMultiValueRegister.cpp are what registers and implements
the iocshell command createMultiValue.</p>
<p>The syntax accepted by createMultiVaue is:</p>
<pre>
channelValueProvider channelProvider
channelName name
channelValue
    fieldName  channelName
    ...
</pre>

<dl>
   <dt>channelProvider</dt>
     <dd>The name of the channelProvider from which data is collected.</dd>
   <dt>name</dt>
     <dd>The channel name for the multiValue instance.</dd>
   <dt>channelValue</dt>
      <dd>This must appear after the previous two lines and must be followed
       by a line for each channel to collect.</dd>
   <dt>fieldName</dt>
      <dd>The name of the field in the multiChannel top level structure.</dd>
   <dt>channelName<dt>
      <dd>The channelName for the channelValueProvider.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>multiValue.h</h3>
<p>This file describes the classes MultiValueChannelProvider, MultiValueChannel, and
MultiValueChannelGet. It is only of interest it You want to understand the code.
If so look at the code.</p>
<h3>valueChannel.h</h3>
<p>This is a <b>wrapper</b> for accessing a channel.
It provides a synchronous interface for accessing a channel.
It currently only provides support for channelGet.
When EasyPVA is available it will not be needed.
</p>

<h2>service</h2>

<p>This is support code for developing network based services that use pvAccess
as the network protocol. In particular the server side of a pvAccess
service.</p>

<p>Service provides support for the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>RPC Service</dt>
    <dd>Support for channelRPC services.</dd>
  <dt>ChannelBase</dt>
    <dd>Base classes for Channel and ChannelProvider. The channel create
      methods just issue an error to the client. A service can extend it and
      implement only the methods required by the service.</dd>
  <dt>PVServiceProvider</dt>
    <dd>A class that is a complete implementation of ChannelProvider. It
      extends ChannelBaseProvider. It can be used by services that create their
      own channelNames with an associated top level structure. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Except for the RPC support, this code is only present because pvIOCCPP does
not implement a pvIOC database, support, etc. When these are created the code
should disappear.</p>

<h3>service.h</h3>

<p>ServiceChannelRPC is a class that implements the server side of channelRPC.
It will call ServiceRPC when a client issues a channelRPC request. It takes
care of all other pvAccess requirements. It has the methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>ServiceChannelRPC</dt>
    <dd>The service must call this constructor. channelName is the name of the
      service. Note that the ServiceRPC implemention must be passed to this

<h3>channelBase.h</h3>

<p>This is the header file for code that implements two classes:
ChannelBaseProvider and ChannelBase. Each is discussed separately.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>A service that implements  only ChannelRPC
can ignore this section.</p>

<h4>channelBaseProvider</h4>

<p>channelBaseProvider takes care of "lifetime" issues. It registers the
provider, keeps a list of all channels the service provider creates and
destroys all channels when the provider is destroyed.</p>

<p>The service must implement the following two ChannelProvider methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>channelFind</dt>
    <dd>The service must keep a list or directory the channel names it
      supports. channelFind looks at the list or directory to see if the
      requested channelName is one that it supports. It calls channelFound to
      report the result. </dd>
  <dt>createChannel</dt>
    <dd>This creates a new Channel if the requested channelName is a name that
      the service supports. createChannel calls either channelNotCreated or
      channelCreated.</dd>
</dl>

<p>channelBaseProvider implements the following methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>channelFound</dt>
    <dd>This is called to report the channelFind request.</dd>
  <dt>channelNotCreated</dt>
    <dd>This is called if createChannel fails.</dd>
  <dt>channelCreated</dt>
    <dd>This is called when a new channel is created. The channel is put on a
      list so that when channelBaseProvider is destroyed it can destroy each
      channel.</dd>
  <dt>removeChannel</dt>
    <dd>This must be called when a channel is destroyed. Note that channels are
      normally destroyed by remote pvAccess rather than because
      channelBaseProvider is destroyed.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>ChannelBase</h4>

<p>This implements all the Channel methods. This a service only needs the
implement the methods it supports. For example a service may only implement
ChannelGet and ChannelPut. In that case it only needs to implement the
createChannelGet and createChannelPut methods of Channel as well as ChannelGet
and ChannelPut.</p>

<h3>pvServiceProvider.h</h3>

<p><b>NOTE: </b>A service that implements  only ChannelRPC
can ignore this section <b>except</b> for PVServiceChannelCTX.</p>

<p>This describes three classes: ServicePVTop, PVServiceProvider, and PVServiceChannelCTX. Each will be
discussed separately.
</p>

<h4>ServicePVTop</h4>
<p>This is the class that a service provider must implement.</p>
<pre>class ServicePVTop
{
public:
    POINTER_DEFINITIONS(ServicePVTop);
    virtual ~ServicePVTop(){}
    virtual epics::pvData::String getName() = 0;
    virtual ChannelBase::shared_pointer createChannel(
        epics::pvAccess::ChannelRequester::shared_pointer const &amp;requester,
        std::tr1::shared_ptr&lt;PVServiceProvider&gt; const &amp;provider) = 0;
    virtual void destroy() = 0;
};</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getName</dt>
    <dd>Get the channel name.</dd>
  <dt>createChannel</dt>
    <dd>Create a channel.</dd>
  <dt>destroy</dt>
    <dd>This is called when the serviceTop itself is being destroyed.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>PVServiceProvider.</h4>

<p>This is a complete implementation of ChannelProvider.
There is a single instance.
The code that uses it
must implement interface ServicePVTop. The code must also create a top level
PVStructure, which is what the pvAccess client will access.
PVServiceProvider has methods:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>addRecord</dt>
  <dt>removeRecord</dt>
</dl>
<p>Each takes an argument ServicePVTop.</p>

<h4>PVServiceChannelCTX.</h4>
<p>This is for use by services that want to run as a standalone service,
i. e. not as part on a V3 IOC. It starts the remote server for pvAccess.
See testApp/exampleServiceRPC/exampleServiceRPCMain.cpp for an example
of how to start it.</p>


<h2>ezchannelRPC.h</h2>

<p>This is pvAccess client code for making a ChannelRPC request. An effort is
being started to develop an easy to use interface to pvAccess. When this
facility is available something like ezchannelRPC will be part of it.</p>

<p>In order to make the example simpler there is also code that implement an
easy to use interface to channelRPC.</p>
<pre>class EZChannelRPC :
    public ChannelRequester,
    public ChannelRPCRequester,
    public std::tr1::enable_shared_from_this&lt;EZChannelRPC&gt;
{
public:
    POINTER_DEFINITIONS(EZChannelRPC);
    EZChannelRPC(
        epics::pvData::String const &amp;channelName);
    EZChannelRPC(
        epics::pvData::String const &amp;channelName,
        epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer pvRequest);
    virtual ~EZChannelRPC();
    void destroy();
    bool connect(double timeout);
    void issueConnect();
    bool waitConnect(double timeout);
    epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer  request(
        epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp; pvArgument,
        bool lastRequest);
    void  issueRequest(
        epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp; pvArgument,
        bool lastRequest);
    epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer  waitRequest();
    epics::pvData::String getMessage();
 ...
}</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>EZChannelRPC</dt>
    <dd>The constructor. The only required argument is the name of the
    service.</dd>
  <dt>destroy</dt>
    <dd>This breaks the connection to the server.</dd>
  <dt>connect</dt>
    <dd>Connect to the server. This calls issueConnect and waitConnect. This it
      blocks until connected of timeout occurs. If false is returned then
      getMessage can be called to find out why the request failed.</dd>
  <dt>issueConnect</dt>
    <dd>Make a connect request by do not block. waitConnect must be called to
      get the result</dd>
  <dt>waitConnect</dt>
    <dd>This blocks until connected of timeout occurs. If false is returned
      then getMessage can be called to find out why the request failed.</dd>
  <dt>request</dt>
    <dd>This makes a channelRPC request. pvArgument is the argument for the
      request. This method just calls issueRequest and waitRequest. Thus it
      blocks. If false is returned then getMessage can be called to find out
      why the request failed.</dd>
  <dt>issueRequest</dt>
    <dd>Makes a channelRPC request and returns immediately. waitRequest must be
      called to get the result.</dd>
  <dt>waitRequest</dt>
    <dd>Wait for the channelRPC to complete. If false is returned then
      getMessage can be called to find out why the request failed.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>exampleServiceRPC</h2>

<p>Currently the only C++ support for services is support for channelRPC, i. e.
support for services where the client and server communicate via
pvAccess::channelRPC. In the near future support is planned for for
channelPutGet.</p>

<p>There is an example service in testApp/exampleServiceRPC. This example can
be run either as a main program or as part of V3 IOC using the v3Channel
support described in the next section. To run it as a main program just execute
the command:</p>
<pre>    bin/&lt;arch&gt;/exampleServiceRPC</pre>

<p>To execute it as part of a V3 IOC do the following:</p>
<pre>cd iocBoot/testV3Channel
 ../../bin/&lt;arch&gt;/testV3Channel st.cmd</pre>

<p>Once the example service is running the example client can be executed, in
another window, via the command:</p>
<pre>    bin/&lt;arch&gt;/exampleClient</pre>

<h3>exampleServiceRPC</h3>

<p>The example is in testApp/exampleServiceRPC. </p>

<p>exampleServiceRPC.h contains:</p>
<pre>class ExampleServiceRPC :
  public virtual ServiceRPC,
  public std::tr1::enable_shared_from_this&lt;ExampleServiceRPC&gt;
{
public:
    POINTER_DEFINITIONS(ExampleServiceRPC);
    ExampleServiceRPC();

    virtual void request(
        epics::pvAccess::ChannelRPCRequester::shared_pointer const &amp; channelRPCRequester,
        epics::pvData::PVStructure::shared_pointer const &amp; pvArgument);
private:
    ExampleServiceRPC::shared_pointer getPtrSelf()
    {
        return shared_from_this();
    }
};</pre>

<p>This just shows how the example extends ServiceRPC. All services should have
a similar definition except for the name, i. e. replace ExampleService with
some other name.</p>

<p>The implementation is in exampleServiceRPC.cpp:</p>
<pre>ExampleServiceRPC::ExampleServiceRPC(){}

    channelRPCRequester-&gt;requestDone(Status::OK,pvStructure);
}</pre>

<p>The only interesting method is request. The example first looks to see if
the argument has the following fields</p>
<dl>
  <dt>function</dt>
    <dd>A string field that represents what the server should do,</dd>
  <dt>names</dt>
    <dd>An array of string names.</dd>
  <dt>values</dt>
    <dd>An array of vales</dd>
</dl>

<p>The idea is that the client passes a function name and a set of name,value
pairs as arguments,</p>

<p>The example creates a structure that represents a table. It has fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>alarm</dt>
    <dd>An alarm field is used to report problems to the client,</dd>
  <dt>timeStamp</dt>
    <dd>The timeStamp for the request.</dd>
  <dt>label</dt>
    <dd>An array of string that is a header for each column of the table. This
      field is followed by a set of scalarArray or structureArray fields. The
      number of fields is equal to the lengh of label. Each array field has the
      same length. For the example there are two additional fields.</dd>
  <dt>position</dt>
    <dd>An array for doubles that represents some kind of position</dd>
  <dt>alarms</dt>
    <dd>An array of alarms. </dd>
</dl>

<p>This structure is returned to the client. Note that
channelRPCRequester-&gt;requestDone(Status::Ok,pvStructure) must be called.</p>

<p>The Make file shows how to build as both a standalone application as as part
of a V3 IOC.\</p>

<p>exampleServiceRPCMain.cpp is the main program for a standalone
application.</p>
<pre>void example()
{
    PVServiceChannelCTX::shared_pointer myCTX
        = PVServiceChannelCTX::shared_pointer(new PVServiceChannelCTX());
    ExampleServiceRPC::shared_pointer example
        = ExampleServiceRPC::shared_pointer(new ExampleServiceRPC());
    ServiceChannelRPC::shared_pointer serviceChannelRPC
        = ServiceChannelRPC::shared_pointer(
            new ServiceChannelRPC("serviceRPC",example));
    cout &lt;&lt; "serviceRPC\n";
    string str;
    while(true) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Type exit to stop: \n";
        getline(cin,str);
        if(str.compare("exit")==0) break;

    }
}

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
    example();
    return 0;
}</pre>

<p>The first statement MUST be present. It starts the pvAccess server. The
second statement creates the service. The next statement is what installs the
service. The remaining statements just wait for the request to terminate the
main program. Except for "ExampleService" any service should have similar
code.</p>

<p>exampleServiceRegister.dbd and exampleServiceRegister.cpp are required to
run the service as part os a V3 IOC. The dbd file is:</p>
<pre>registrar("startExampleServiceRegister")</pre>

<p>This is the dbd statement that will have the V3 IOC register the code
desctribed in the next file:</p>

<p>The cpp file is:</p>
<pre>/* define arguments for the following command:
 * startExampleService channelName
 */
static const iocshArg startExampleServiceArg0 = {"channelName", iocshArgString};
static const iocshArg *const startExampleServiceArgs[] = {
    &amp;startExampleServiceArg0};
static const iocshFuncDef startExampleServiceFuncDef = {
    "startExampleService", 1, startExampleServiceArgs};
static void startExampleService(const iocshArgBuf *args)
{
    // the channel name is the single argument which is a string
    const char * channelName = args[0].sval;
    if(channelName==0 || channelName[0]==0) {
        printf("illegal channelName\n");
        return;
    }
    ExampleServiceRPC::shared_pointer example
        = ExampleServiceRPC::shared_pointer(new ExampleServiceRPC());
    ServiceChannelRPC *serviceChannelRPC
        = new ServiceChannelRPC("serviceRPC",example);
}

static void startExampleServiceRegister(void)
{
    static int firstTime = 1;
    if (firstTime) {
        firstTime = 0;
        iocshRegister(&amp;startExampleServiceFuncDef, startExampleService);
    }
}

epicsExportRegistrar(startExampleServiceRegister);</pre>

<p>Again any service can provide similar code. Just change ExampleService to
something else.</p>

<h3>exampleClient</h3>

<p>An example client that calls the exampleServerRPC is also in
pvIOCCPP/testApp/exampleServiceRPC.</p>

<p>The client code uses the ezchanelRPC support discussed in a previous
section.</p>
