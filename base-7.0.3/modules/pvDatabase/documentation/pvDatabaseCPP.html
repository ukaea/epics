<h1>pvDatabaseCPP</h1>
<h2 class="nocount">Release ? - TBD</h2>
Latest update 2019.06.19.


<h2 class="nocount">Abstract</h2>

<p>This document describes pvDatabaseCPP,
which is a framework for implementing a network accessible database of smart memory resident
records. Network access is via pvAccess. The data in each record is a top level PVStructure as defined by
pvData. The framework includes a complete implementation of ChannelProvider as defined by pvAccess.
The framework can be extended in order to create record instances that implements services.
The minimum that an extension must provide is a top level PVStructure and a process method.
</p>
  <!-- last para of Abstract is boilerplate reference to EPICS -->

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
pvDatabaseCPP is one of the components of
EPICS Version 7
</p>
<p>This document is only a guide to help locate code and documentation related to pvDatabaseCPP
It is intended for developers that want to use pvDatabaseCPP.
</p>
<h2>Developer Guide</h2>
<p>A guide for developers is available at
<a
href="https://mrkraimer.github.io/website/developerGuide/developerGuide.html">
developerGuide
</a>
</p>
<p>This guide discusses all the components that are part of an <b>EPICS V4</b> release.
Some understanding of the components and how they are related is necessary in order to
develop code that uses pvDatabaseCPP.
In particular read everything related to pvDatabase.
</p>
<p>pvDatabase has plugin support, which is implemented in <b>pvCopy</b>.
<b>pvCopy</b> was originally implemented in <b>pvDataCPP</b>,
but pvDatabaseCPP now implements its own version and adds plugin support.
</p>
<p>
See
<a
href="https://mrkraimer.github.io/website/pvRequest/pvRequest.html">
pvRequest
</a>
for details.
</p>
<p>The developerGuide discusses code in a way that applies to both CPP and C++.
For the descriptions of the CPP specific code consult the following sections.
</p>

<h2>doxygen</h2>

</p> 
<h2>exampleCPP</h2>
<p>Example code is available as part of this release.
<a
href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleCPP">
exampleCPP
</a>
</p>
<p>In particular look at the example code mentioned in the following sub-sections.
</p>

<h3>database</h3>
<p>This has many examples of how to create both soft records and records that implement
other functionality.</p>
<dl>
   <dt>exampleDatabase.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
      This shows how to create soft records of each pvData type.<br />
      In addition shows how to create instances of the following two records.
     </dd>
   <dt>exampleHelloRecord.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
       This is a simple "hello world" that is intentended to be used via a channelPutGet request.
     </dd>
   <dt>exampleHelloRPC.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
       This is a simple "hello world" that is intentended to be used via a channelRPC request.
     </dd>
   <dt>exampleDatabaseMain.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
      This shows how to create a standalone IOC.
     </dd>
   <dt>ioc and iocBoot</dt>
     <dd>
      This has code and examples to create a V3 IOC which also has a PVDatabase.
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>exampleLink</h3>
<p>This shows how to implement a record that has a link to another record</p>
<dl>
  <dt>exampleMonitorLinkRecord</dt>
     <dd>
      This creates a monitor link to another record.
     </dd>
  <dt>exampleGetLinkRecord</dt>
     <dd>
      This creates a get link to another record.
     </dd>
  <dt>examplePutLinkRecord</dt>
     <dd>
      This creates a put link to another record.
     </dd>
</dl>

<h3>support</h3>
<p>This creates records that have the following features:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>value</dt>
   <dd>
    Each record has a value field the is a numeric scalar field.
    In addition each has the following fields:
    alarm,timeStamp,control,scalarAlarm, and display.
   </dd>
   <dt>support</dt>
   <dd>
     Each record uses the control and scalarAlarm support provided by pvDatabaseCPP.
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>
It also creates records that can be used by clients to show example of the plugin support.
</p>

<h2>iocshell commands</h2>
<p>Shell commands are made available via the standard DBD include mechanism
provided by iocCore.
The following provide EPICS V4 shell commands:</p>
<pre>
pvAccessCPP
qsrv
pvDatabaseCPP
</pre>

<p>pvDatabaseCPP provides the following iocshell command.</p>
<dl>
   <dt>registerChannelProviderLocal</dt>
     <dd>Including <b>registerChannelProviderLocal.dbd</b> as a dbd file automatically starts provider local
      and also creates the pvdbl shell command.
     </dd>
   <dt>pvdbl</dt>
      <dd>Provides a list of all the pvRecords in database <b>master</b>
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition any code that implements a PVRecord must implement an ioc command.
Look at the examples in <b>exampleCPP/support</b> to see how to implement shell commands.</p>
