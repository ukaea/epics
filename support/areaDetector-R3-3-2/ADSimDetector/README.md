ADSimDetector
=============
The home of the simDetector for the
[EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/) 
[areaDetector](http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html) 
software.  It contains this example driver and an example IOC directory.

Prior to R2-3 the files in this repository were contained in the ADExample
repository.  ADSimDetector was split into its own repository on Nov. 22, 2016
and the first release of the new repository was called R2-3 to continue the
release numbering from ADExample.
