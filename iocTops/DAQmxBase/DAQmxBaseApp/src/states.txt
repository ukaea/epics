This document describes the state machine.

MESSAGE: msgNoAction
Does nothing

MESSAGE: msgConfigure
Should configure/reconfigure
if unconfigured - state = configure
if idle - state = reconfigure
else if not configure - state = stop
(stopping the task will result in idle -> reconfigure)

MESSAGE: msgStart
if idle or start - state = start 
if unconfigured - state = configure
if running - state = stop -> result in reconfigure

MESSAGE: msgStop

default startup state - waits

STATE: reconfigure
Clears task

if daqmode = Input : start task
interrupt ACQUIRE interface
depending on daqmode:
 state = acquireAnlg or acquireDig or acquireCnt or counterout or write

STATE: busywait
wait for event

Should maybe create some diagram picture to represent this? -H
